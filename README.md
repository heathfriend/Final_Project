# Final_Project

# June 4th

---Today majority of the day was spent researching and watching videos of Materialize. I have been very nervous about this project and my future in this field. It's been a wild ride, leaving a field I was good at but a toxic work environment to gamble on myself and now that gamble is either gonna pay off or not. Very scared but yet excited (mostly scared to be honest). Ive gotten a couple routes working but nothing crazy, hoping to get in a flow tomorrow.
