# Final_Project

# June 4th
____________
---Today majority of the day was spent researching and watching videos of Materialize. I have been very nervous about this project and my future in this field. It's been a wild ride, leaving a field I was good at but a toxic work environment to gamble on myself and now that gamble is either gonna pay off or not. Very scared but yet excited (mostly scared to be honest). Ive gotten a couple routes working but nothing crazy, hoping to get in a flow tomorrow.

--Another day feeling less anxious and more excited and more determined to finish this and move forward.
ONE HOUR LATER...
--Deleting everything and restarting...
--Really funny moment for me going back through.. I hit a bug and used the class video to see what my bug was or if someone else experienced it...I made the exact same mistake in class (face palm).

# June 8th
--- Getting my butt kicked everywhere and not finding any success. Frustration and emotions are getting the best of me. I just keep making my situation worse and don't even realize it until its too late.

# June 9th
--toughest day. Got full crud again but cant deploy...Cant get materialize to connect... this is a mess and I just want to crawl up in a ball and quit. This is ridiculous. No idea why its this hard...
